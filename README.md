<h3>Data Structure</h3>

<h4>List</h4>
<b>Problem</b>

Initialize a method that will return a random list of integers.
The method will take 3 arugments,
- first the minimum random integer
- second the maximum random integer
- third the size or count of the list

<b>Algorithm</b>

1.first create a method named RandomIntList
2.initialize two variable first is the list that will be return by the function then
second is Random class.
3.Using forloop loop it until the iteration variable is not less than by the size of the list.
4. Every loop add the random integer to the list
5. After the loop return the list.

<h4>Queue</h4>
<b>Problem</b>
Create a generic class so that any data can be added to the queue. After that create a
method named AddMultiple that will take two arguments
1. array
2. queue

<b>Algorithm</b>
1. Create a methon named AddMultiple then add two argument to the function first the array 
then the queue
2. Use a foreach loop on the array then Enqueue or add every item to the queue

<h4>Stack</h4>
<b>Problem</b>
Create a generic class so that any data can be added to the stack. After that create a
method named AddMultiple that will take two arguments
1. array
2. stack

<b>Algorithm</b>
1. Create a methon named AddMultiple then add two argument to the function first the array 
then the stacj
2. Use a foreach loop on the array then push or add every item to the stack

<h4>Linked List</h4>
<b>Problem</b>
Create a method named AddToEnd that will add new data/item to the Linked List. 
This method will take one argument which is the data that will be added.

<b>Algorithm</b>
0. This is a recursive method/function
1. First create a method named AddToEnd with one argument for the data
2. create an if statement that if the pointer to next data is equal to null then
we wil set the pointer equal to new LinkList data
3. else we will call again the function

<h3>Sorting Algorithm</h3>

<h4>Selection Sort</h4>
<b>Problem</b>
Create a method that will sort an array of integers

<b> Algorithm</b>
1. Initialize 3 new variables. <b>Counter</b>, <b>Traversing Index</b>, <b>Minimum Index</b>.
2. Set Counter equal to 0, Minimum Index equal to Counter, Traversing Index is equal to
Counter plus 1.
3. Search the list from Counter through the end of the data using Traversing Index, and
compare every element we pass over to the value stored at the Minimum Index
  a. If the value is less than the value stored at the Minimum Index, we re-set Minimimum
  Index to what Traversing Index is.
4. After Traversing the whole list, we swap the values counting at Counter and the
Minimum Index.
5. Increase Counter by 1, set Minimum Index equal to the Counter, and set the Traversing
Index equal to 1 plus the Counter.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until it is sorted.

<h4>Insertion Sort</h4>

Create a method that will sort an array of integers

<b>Algorithm<b>

<h4>Quick Sort</h4>
<b>Problem</b>
Create a method that will sort an array of integers

<b>Algorithm</b>
E search rasab haha

<h3>Search Algorithm</h3>
<h4>Binary Search</h4>

<b>Problem</b>
Create a method that will take two arguments which is the array and the target item.
This method will search through a sorted array and if the the target is found return the
index of the target if not return -1.

<b>Algorithm</b>
